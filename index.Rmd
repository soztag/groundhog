## Introduction

## Item Generation

### Q-Distribution

```{r include = FALSE}
distro <- qmethod::make.distribution(nstat = 59, max.bin = 7)
names(distro) <- -7:7
# TODO there is a bug here; this should work without specifiyng chessboard, null should default fine
grid <- pensieve::as_psGrid(obj = distro, pattern = "chessboard")
```

### Plotting Items

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
items <- readr::read_csv(file = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSkT1N44FpPcqAcAp1eChsHI0jlw-F0gqB7w1Sl4ksd6q3vNAoBbkjrx0rjlYc_7hhJiZ0uHvmxKRon/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv")
readr::write_rds(x = items, path = "items.rds")
```

```{r items, include = FALSE}
raw_items <- readr::read_rds(path = "items.rds")
items <- matrix(
  data = as.matrix(raw_items[,c("english", "german")]),
  nrow = nrow(raw_items),
  dimnames = list(items = raw_items$shorthandle, languages = c("english", "ngerman"))
)
# write out hashes and df
hash_de <- sapply(X = items[, "ngerman"], FUN = function(x) {
  digest::digest(object = x, algo = "crc32", serialize = FALSE)
})
hash_en <- sapply(X = items[, "english"], FUN = function(x) {
  digest::digest(object = x, algo = "crc32", serialize = FALSE)
})
input_helper_df <- data.frame(
  full_en = items[,"english"],
  full_de = items[,"ngerman"],
  handle = rownames(items),
  hash_en = hash_en,
  hash_de = hash_de
)
readr::write_csv(x = input_helper_df, path = "input_helper.csv")
```

```{r plot-items, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(qmethod)
qmethod::make.cards(
  q.set = items,
  study.language = "english", 
  output.pdf = TRUE, 
  babel.language = "english", 
  show.handles = FALSE, 
  duplex.double = TRUE, 
  wording.font.size = "\\large",
  file.name = "english")
qmethod::make.cards(
  q.set = items,
  study.language = "ngerman", 
  output.pdf = TRUE, 
  babel.language = "ngerman", 
  show.handles = FALSE, 
  duplex.double = TRUE, 
  wording.font.size = "\\large",
  file.name = "german")
```


## Field Work

Participants were given the following prompt:

> Imagine that, starting now, the next week will repeat itself once.
> In a week, the whole universe will rewind to today, all changes are undone and memories erased.
> You are the only person who knows this, and you alone will remember what happened during this week.
> What would you do?
>
> Rank the following items according to your likelihood for enacting them in the next week.
> Rank all activities highly which you like, even if you could not complete them all in the given time.
>
> Remember that whatever you do in the next seven days would be completely undone at the end of the week; only your memories remain.


Or, in German:

> Stelle dir vor, dass sich die n√§chste Woche genau ein Mal wiederholt.
> Am Ende der Woche dreht sich die Zeit zur√ºck auf den heutigen Tag. Alle Ver√§nderungen sind revidiert und Erinnerungen gel√∂scht.
> Du bist die einzige Person, die √ºber diese Wiederholung wei√ü und nur du kannst dich in Zukunft daran erinnern, was in der Woche passiert ist.
>
> Sortiere die folgenden Aktivit√§ten danach, wie wahrscheinlich du sie in der Woche durchf√ºhren w√ºrdest.
> Es ist nicht wichtig, ob du die pr√§ferierten Aktivit√§ten auch alle schaffen k√∂nntest.
>
> Denke daran, dass alle √Ñnderungen im Universum am Ende der Woche r√ºckg√§ngig gemacht werden; nur deine Erinnerungen bleiben.


Participants were given the following sorting instructions:

> 1. Choose a pseudonym, so that you can recognize your own datapoints in the results.
    ![](img/pseudo.jpg)
> 1. Read through all the items carefully. 
     Make notes on the items if you like.
> 2. Preliminarily sort the items into three piles:
     1. Items you like.
     2. Items you do not understand or are ambivalent about.
     3. Items you dislike.
     ![](img/presort.jpg)
> 3. Rank-order the items according to how likely you are to do the described activities, from the right (likely to do) to the left (unlikely to do).
      Start with items from the right (likely to do), continue with items from the left (unlikely to do), and finally fill in the middle (ambivalent).
> 4. Consider your completed sort, and revise item positions if necessary.
      ![](img/sort.jpg)
> 5. Add comments to items you feel strongly about, or do not understand.
> 6. Turn all items on their back (only showing a random string), and ask the investigator to take a picture of your completed sort.

Participants were reminded:

> - There is no correct or consistent way to complete your Q sort; whatever you feel expresses your subjective view on the matter is correct. 
>   This is not a test - There is no "right answer".
> - Only the horizontal dimension (from left to right) matters; the vertical axis does not matter.
  Items on top of one another merely express ties.
> If you are ambivalent about an item or do not understand it, place it in the middle between the two extremes.
  This is valuable information, too.
> - You must place all items.
> - You must adhere to the distribution.
> - Only *relative* positions matter.
    For example, you may feel positively about *more* than half of the items, and have only very few neutral or negative items.


Important notes for **the investigators**:

- Remember to sample a *diverse* group of people who are likely to display *different* viewpoints on the subject matter.
- We are not going to gather *any* personal data.
  Make sure not to pollute the gathered data with any information that might deanonymize your participants.
  For example *do not* record their email adress on the cards, and make sure that their pseudonyms are properly anonymous.
  If you want to email the results to the participants, store their contact information *separately* and securely, with no reference to the study.
- **Make sure to test the photo you're taking at the end to record the sort**: 
    - Are the item codes legible? 
    - Is the lighting ok?
    - Is the resolution high enough?
    - Is the pseudonym card in the picture?
    - Save several copies of these images.
    - (If possible, delete date and location metadata from these images).
- There may be a tradeoff in our study between a) getting deep, qualitative insights from observing and discussing the sorting behavior and b) avoiding social desirability biases.
  Participants may not feel free to sort some items (e.g. anti-social and sexual), when they are closely observed, or know that the investigator (= you), will "know" their Q sort.
  (For this reason, the item backs are marked with arbitrary codes for identification, so that participants never have to "show" their sorts to the investigators.)
  It's not clear what we should do here, because on the other hand, we probably cannot produce proper anonymity in in-person sorts, and we may also want to closely observe and engage the participants.
- Take the time to carefully discuss the sorting procedure with participants after they are done.
  If you want to (see above caveat), also sit next to them while they sort and prompt them to explain their choices.
  **Take notes!**
- Remind participants to add feedback or any thoughts and comments to the items.
  They can write them on the cards.
  **Provide participants with pens or pencils.**
- When you are preparing the cards, make sure that every participant has a complete set (and no duplicates). 
  This can be quite difficult and requires *very* careful preparation (envelopes are useful).
- Explain the procedure very carefully to the participants, and **show them pictures of the completed sorts**.
  Otherwise, it can be quite hard to understand the methodology.
  In particular, remind them that only the horizontal axis matters, what the extremes are, and that they must adhere to the forced distribution.
- This procedure takes time and some quiet patience (> 60 minutes), as well as some space (e.g. a free table).
  Plan accordingly.

## Analysis


## Interpretation

###Factor Interpretation

*by Eleni Sarri*



### Factor 1
<!-- TODO add proper factor names as heading -->
The majority of the participants scored high on factor 1.
By looking at the binned scores the participants valued financial advancement and self-centered activities the most.
The Items "Memorize the lottery numbers" and "Place some financial insider trades in the re-run, profiting from my knownledge of the future" were placed on the positive end characterizing the q-sorting of this factor as future-oriented and practical.
On the negative end were positioned the barbarous and violent items such as "Kidnap a child to see how it is to be a parent" and "Kill somebody".
Interpreting it as the q-sorters abhorring such extreme and non-ethical actions.
In the center the participants who scored high on factor 1 were indifferent about the Items "Do extreme sports", "Try a lot of drugs" or "Get a tattoo to see if i like it"  and were considered not important in this situation.
The Factor 1 score for these Items indicate  a very similar sorting, as they are a darker shade making their standard deviation low.
The outer ends are lighty shaded meaning that the sorting of these Items deviated from participant to participant.
These results strengthen the forward -thinking, egocentrical and sucess driven attitude of the sorters belonging to factor 1. 
They put more significance on the days following the groundhog event to build a better future with financial stability, as well as improve and take care of  themselves, even  though every action will be reset.  


### Factor 2

Factor 2 displays many similarities with the Factor 1.
On the positive end scored high the Items "Memorize the lottery numbers" and "Place some financial insider trades in the re-run, profiting from my knownledge of the future".
The only difference with Factor 1 is that these 2 statements are a darker shade indicating the standard deviation between the participants who placed these items on the positive extreme isnt high.
On the negative side are mostly the usual mundane activities located like "Act normally, out of fear that time will not be rewound" or "Going about my business as usual".
While on the neutral middle the participants were ambivalent about the destructive and unethical Items such as "Be destructive and violent" or "Burn down state facilities".
This fact can be interpreted as the individuals being inquisitive and curious. 
Wanting to break the routine.
To try new things, experience something that they can¥t or haven¥t, because of their own fears, unchangeable lifechoices or ethical aspects.
Do something they always wanted, but simultaneoulsy having the calming knownledge that everything will be reversed without them having to face the consequences of their actions. 
Which is interesting comparing it to Factor 1. 
The characteristic of factor 1 is future-oriented, while Factor 2 more present-oriented. 


### Factor 3

Factor 3 is the most difficult to interpret.
From all the 36 q-sorters only 3 people scored high on this one.
Most of the items are dark shaded meaning that they dont deviate with the 3 original q-sortings of the 3 participants. 
So "Cheat on my partner" and "Go around and tell everyone how i really feel about them" were the items they would most likely do in a groundhog situation.
Acting in a rebellious and spontaneous way.
At some points it seems a little bit randomly  sorted.
Surprisingly the violent Items were placed on the negative extreme.
With such a seemingly impulsive sorting it would have been expected that the uncivilized and brutal activities would have scored higher on their sorting.
Another surprise is the Item "Memorize the lottery numbers" for the other factors was the most agreed on Item. 
On Factor 3, however, it was placed on the negative side.
Making it insignificant.
That makes the  assumption stronger that they are individuals with a different unusual mindset and unpredictable behaviour. 
Enjoying this groundhog oppurtinity like a  new found freedom. 
It should be mentioned that there is a possibility that the sorting of the participants who loaded high on Factor 3 could have been influenced by another factor being present at the time of ther sorting.


## Conclusion

*by Eleni Sarri*

To conclude people will react differently given the oppurtinity to repeat a week once more.
Some want to ameliorate their current living situation and build a stable secure future.
Others will use this situation to try new foreign things, with the assurance that everything will be back to how it previously was and with no one remembering it. 
Lastly, some individuals will act spontaneously and free-spirited with nothing stopping from acting with no consideration for others.
